# TensorFlow Decision Forests

**TensorFlow Decision Forests** (**TF-DF**) is a collection of state-of-the-art
algorithms for the training, serving and interpretation of **Decision Forest**
models. The library is a collection of [Keras](https://keras.io/) models and
supports classification, regression and ranking.

**TF-DF** is a [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) wrapper around the
[Yggdrasil Decision Forests](https://github.com/google/yggdrasil-decision-forests)
C++ libraries. Models trained with TF-DF are compatible with Yggdrasil Decision
Forests' models, and vice versa.
[This link](https://github.com/google/yggdrasil-decision-forests/blob/main/documentation/user_manual.md#serving-tensorflow-decision-forests-model)
explains how to do inference of TF-DF models in C++ using Yggdrasil.

## Usage example

A minimal end-to-end run looks as follow:

```python
import tensorflow_decision_forests as tfdf
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset in a Pandas dataframe.
train_df = pd.read_csv("project/train.csv")
test_df = pd.read_csv("project/test.csv")

# Convert the dataset into a TensorFlow dataset.
train_ds = tfdf.keras.pd_dataframe_to_tf_dataset(train_df, label="my_label")
test_ds = tfdf.keras.pd_dataframe_to_tf_dataset(test_df, label="my_label")

# Train the model
model = tfdf.keras.RandomForestModel()
model.fit(train_ds)

# Look at the model.
model.summary()

# Evaluate the model.
model.evaluate(test_ds)

# Export to a TensorFlow SavedModel.
# Note: the model is compatible with Yggdrasil Decision Forests.
model.save("project/model")
```
